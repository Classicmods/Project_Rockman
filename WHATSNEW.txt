***WARNINGS***
Drives fail eventually, and filesystems can be corrupted.
PLEASE BACK THESE FILES UP TO A SAFE LOCATION!!!
WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU LOSE THESE FILES!!!
SERIOUSLY DON'T MAKE IT HARDER TO RESTORE YOUR SYSTEM!!!

The following files will be created:

LBOOT.EPB - The boot files for the PSC. This is the filesystem backup. 
LBOOT_KERNEL.EPB - The default kernel for the PSC.
LRECOVERY.EPB - The recovery partitions.

* USB OTG Support
This version of the BleemSync payload supports use of a custom kernel that enables USB OTG. This supports the use of a USB OTG adapter in the rear USB (power) port. This will bypass the power limitations of the front ports to allow the use of nearly all storage or controller devices. The kernel is installed separately. Please see below.

* Kernel install
This version of the BleemSync payload supports installation of an updated LINUX kernel. Please be aware that this can be a harmful change that can brick your device. While the team has done everything possible to ensure this can be done safely, please follow the proper guidelines for flashing a payload.

Please only install kernels from trusted sources. Updated kernel should be placed in /media/bleemsync/update, and will flash on next boot. Use the RESTORE_KERNEL flag in the /media/bleemsync/flags directory if you want to restore to stock.

* Updated xpad.ko
This driver was updated to the latest mainline LINUX source for increased compatibility with controllers.

* New option for adding games to BleemSync UI
Playstation games can now be added to the BSUI by dropping them into /media/transfer.
Multidisc games are supported. Naming format should be GameName(Disc 1) GameName(Disc 2) etc.
Mutitrack games are supported so long as the name format conforms to "GameName (Track 1).bin", "GameName (Track 2).bin" etc.
Custom cover images (PNG) can also be added to the transfer folder. The image must have the same filename as the game.
Games requiring SBI files must have the SBI file added in the transfer folder. The name of the SBI file must either match the serial or filename of the corresponding game.


Formats supported:

BIN/CUE
ISO
IMG
PBP

* BleemSync Settings Menu
BleemSync settings can now be changed directly on the console. To open the Settings Menu press L1 while on the Boot Menu Screen. Note: The console will restart after saving new settings.

* RetroArch Playlist Generation
Setting the "generate_external_game_playlist" variable in the BleemSync Settings to TRUE will enable automatic playlist generation for all external(USB) psx games added to the stock menu. Thumbnails will automatically be linked to the playlist but must be in PNG format to display in RetroArch.

* RetroArch Update
The version of RetroArch included with BleemSync has been updated. The black screen freeze issues that occurred in previous versions have been fixed. GLUI menu is now available for use. Support for compressed RA cores has also been added.

* Custom Application Launchers for Stock UI
The ability to create custom application launchers for the stock UI has been added. By default there are 2 launchers included with BleemSync a RetroArch launcher and a Boot Menu Launcher. For more information about launchers and how to create your own see /bleemsync/etc/bleemsync/SUP/launchers/README.md

* 3rd Party Controller Support for Stock UI
The stock UI and emulator can now be used with 3rd party controllers. The 3rd party controllers are used to emulate the stock controller input as such the left analog stick is mapped to the d-pad and the right analog stick is not functional.
